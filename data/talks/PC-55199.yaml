talk_abstract: "Last year, I open-sourced my first library, PyMC3 Models. This talk has two parts: things I learned as I was writing my library and some of the issues I faced being the sole maintainer of the library. I hope you’ll be encouraged to open source and maintain your own library after this!"

talk_details: |
  Last year, I open sourced my first library, PyMC3 Models, which features custom PyMC3 models built on top 
  of the scikit-learn API. This talk is about some of the things I learned along the way.

  The first half will focus on lessons learned while writing my library\: 
  - The importance of just starting: releasing even a small bit of work is worthwhile because it could help someone. 
  - Using toy examples: implementing a basic linear regression helped me improve the broader structure of my package. 
  - Documentation: Spending time on documentation was tedious in the beginning, but paid off in the long run. 
  - Copying: I borrowed heavily from other open source libraries and that’s totally ok!

  The second half will focus on being the sole maintainer of the library including: 
  - how to handle normal contributions 
  - strategies for dealing with aggressive contributors 
  - taking care of yourself when you’re the only one working on a library

  I hope this talk will encourage you to start your own library and give you some tools as you maintain it.
